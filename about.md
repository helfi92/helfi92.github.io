title: About me 
---
I’m passionate about what I do, and I love to help people. Nothing is more rewarding than being part of a team that shares similar interests and an organization that values its employees. I’m currently interested in front end development, reactive functional programming (RFP) and UI architecture. When I’m not working, I’m continually taking action to learn and apply new things through books, blogs, podcasts, and conferences.
I'm [@hassanhelfi](https://twitter.com/hassanhelfi) on Twitter.
