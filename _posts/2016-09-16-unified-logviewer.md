The Unified Log Viewer is a new project initiated by [Eli Perelman](http://eliperelman.com/), with the goal of eventually replacing Treeherder current log viewer. I interviwed people this summer asking them about their workflow and I had received multiple complaints regarding the current log viewer. See interview results [here](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/taskcluster-dashboard-interviews). For example, the browser would crash when presented with a very big log file and users are not able to jump to a line number in the log.
The new log viewer project is currently being hosted on the [Taskcluster Github](https://github.com/taskcluster/unified-logviewer). We are always open for the public contributions. We would love to have a PR sent by you.
